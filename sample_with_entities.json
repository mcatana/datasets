Science for Customer Satisfaction</b></p> <p>This event is in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-for-Sustainability/events/235306257/\">Data Science for Sustainability</a> Meetup group. </p> <p><b>About the Event</b>:</p> <p>As one of the leaders in the solar market, <a href=\"http://www.solarcity.com/\">SolarCity</a> has leveraged data science approaches to focus on the customers' needs. In this talk we will hear about how SolarCity uses data to better identify and serve customers during the sales process, followed by a discussion on how data science is used after the solar systems are installed to ensure that the fleet is being efficiently operated and managed. </p> <p><b>About the Presenters</b>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiekempner\">Maggie Kempner</a> is a Process Engineer at SolarCity and  helps sales leaders make decisions on ways to meet growth targets. She does this by focusing on the customer - where to best target them, how to most effectively explain solar, what the permitting environments are like for various geographic areas, etc. In this talk, Maggie will discuss how SolarCity uses data science to support customers through every step of the sales process. Maggie formerly did demand response analytics at EnerNOC after a career as a foreign exchange trader.  She holds degrees in economics and psychology from Kenyon College.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-rao-aaaa5130\">Neha Rao</a> works as a Performance and Analytics Manager at SolarCity. Neha manages the Performance and Analytics teams at SolarCity, which detect and review failures and performance issues with photovoltaic systems, and determine next steps for the Operations and Maintenance department. One of O&amp;M’s primary goals is to identify and remediate correctable issues that arise with photovoltaic systems as soon as possible. Teasing out the effect of weather is the first step to finding correctable issues. An inexpensive approach is to compare performance to other systems in the vicinity, however this approach has its drawbacks. The presentation will go over a cost-benefit analysis of using satellite-derived irradiance instead of a regionally adjusted index to arrive at weather-normalized photovoltaic system performance. Neha’s educational background is in engineering. She honed her data analysis skills at her first job at a business consulting firm, and continues to do so at SolarCity. </p> <p><b>Agenda</b>:</p> <p>6:30pm - Doors open, networking, light refreshments</p> <p>7:00pm - Presentation</p> <p><b>About Galvanize</b>:</p> <p>Galvanize is an education company that blends the lines between learning and working.

In this talk we will hear about how SolarCity uses data to better identify and serve customers during the sales process, followed by a discussion on how data science is used after the solar systems are installed to ensure that the fleet is being efficiently operated and managed.\n\nAbout the Presenters:\n\nMaggie Kempner (https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiekempner) is a Process Engineer at SolarCity and helps sales leaders make decisions on ways to meet growth targets. She does this by focusing on the customer - where to best target them, how to most effectively explain solar, what the permitting environments are like for various geographic areas, etc. In this talk, Maggie will discuss how SolarCity uses data science to support customers through every step of the sales process. Maggie formerly did demand response analytics at EnerNOC after a career as a foreign exchange trader. She holds degrees in economics and psychology from Kenyon College.\n\nNeha Rao (https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-rao-aaaa5130) works as a Performance and Analytics Manager at SolarCity. Neha manages the Performance and Analytics teams at SolarCity, which detect and review failures and performance issues with photovoltaic systems, and determine next steps for the Operations and Maintenance department. One of O&M’s primary goals is to identify and remediate correctable issues that arise with photovoltaic systems as soon as possible. Teasing out the effect of weather is the first step to finding correctable issues. An inexpensive approach is to compare performance to other systems in the vicinity, however this approach has its drawbacks. The presentation will go over a cost-benefit analysis of using satellite-derived irradiance instead of a regionally adjusted index to arrive at weather-normalized photovoltaic system performance. Neha’s educational background is in engineering. She honed her data analysis skills at her first job at a business consulting firm, and continues to do so at SolarCity.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:30pm - Doors open, networking, light refreshments\n\n7:00pm - Presentation\n\nAbout Galvanize:\n\nGalvanize is an education company that blends the lines between learning and working. We believe in creating easy access for anyone who has the drive and determination to jump into the tech world, especially in entrepreneurship, engineering, and data science. Our campuses are home to students, startups, investors, mentors, and other people who are engaged and excited to level up their skills.

Delroy Cameron will discuss how the URX team approaches this task, using big data and data science.\n\nPrerequisites:\nIntermediate Level\n\nTopics:\n\nVector Space Model, Machine Learning, Python, Gensim, Information Extraction\n\nWhat to bring:\nLaptop, Mobile Phone\n\nMeet the Speaker:\nDelroy Cameron (http://twitter.com/delroycam)is a Data Scientist at URX, where he conducts applied research in the areas of knowledge representation, information extraction, and machine learning. Prior to joining URX, he received his PhD in Computer Science from Wright State University in 2014.","created_at":1448943022,"happened_at":1455070500},{"id":"dtmvxgywmbjc","name":"Code and beer","link":"https://www.meetup.com/The-Bucharest-Agile-Software-Meetup-Group/events/dtmvxgywmbjc/","entities":[],"keyPhrases":[{"score":0.9849333,"text":"WhatThe code and beer idea","beginOffset":0,"endOffset":26},{"score":0.99999887,"text":"the evening","beginOffset":58,"endOffset":69},{"score":0.9999503,"text":"work","beginOffset":76,"endOffset":80},{"score":0.9999995,"text":"a pub","beginOffset":85,"endOffset":90},{"score":0.9999999,"text":"a beer","beginOffset":97,"endOffset":103},{"score":0.99999934,"text":"some code","beginOffset":114,"endOffset":123},{"score":0.9999943,"text":"a social coding event","beginOffset":131,"endOffset":152},{"score":0.9998559,"text":"ideas","beginOffset":173,"endOffset":178},{"score":0.9999994,"text":"other developers","beginOffset":184,"endOffset":200},{"score":0.9663384,"text":"usMeet other programmersWork","beginOffset":271,"endOffset":299},{"score":0.9995788,"text":"your own projectHelp others","beginOffset":303,"endOffset":330},{"score":0.9999853,"text":"their projectsFind someone","beginOffset":336,"endOffset":362},{"score":0.9999996,"text":"a specific topicPair","beginOffset":387,"endOffset":407},{"score":0.9999545,"text":"new thingsJust","beginOffset":431,"endOffset":445},{"score":0.9999991,"text":"your laptop","beginOffset":485,"endOffset":496},{"score":0.99981743,"text":"some code","beginOffset":501,"endOffset":510},{"score":0.9983754,"text":"code","beginOffset":556,"endOffset":560},{"score":0.99999934,"text":"the evening.There","beginOffset":617,"endOffset":634},{"score":0.99962837,"text":"no predefined agenda","beginOffset":638,"endOffset":658},{"score":0.9999988,"text":"the evening","beginOffset":764,"endOffset":775},{"score":0.9999953,"text":"the question","beginOffset":789,"endOffset":801},{"score":0.99998903,"text":"the meeting","beginOffset":905,"endOffset":916},{"score":0.9999903,"text":"your RSVP","beginOffset":931,"endOffset":940},{"score":0.99996084,"text":"this gesture","beginOffset":969,"endOffset":981},{"score":0.99999815,"text":"a sign","beginOffset":982,"endOffset":988},{"score":0.9999995,"text":"respect","beginOffset":992,"endOffset":999},{"score":1.0,"text":"other members","beginOffset":1008,"endOffset":1021},{"score":0.99999994,"text":"this group","beginOffset":1025,"endOffset":1035},{"score":0.99999946,"text":"your place.The number","beginOffset":1064,"endOffset":1085},{"score":0.99999917,"text":"attendees","beginOffset":1089,"endOffset":1098},{"score":0.99999976,"text":"the difficulties","beginOffset":1121,"endOffset":1137},{"score":0.9999998,"text":"a big pub","beginOffset":1149,"endOffset":1158},{"score":0.99999964,"text":"reservations","beginOffset":1170,"endOffset":1182},{"score":0.99999994,"text":"a big group","beginOffset":1187,"endOffset":1198}],"group_id":1305678,"description_html":"<p><b>What</b></p> <p>The code and beer idea is simple enough: we gather in the evening after work, in a pub, have a beer and write some code.

Some scientists assert the need for an underlying global theory on a par with the invention of calculus. A broader theoretical model should integrate various techniques and tools being developed. Machine Learning currently serves as a standard technique for big data analysis. Many of the methods in machine learning are most effective when working with data matrices or sets of vectors. In many cases, data sets are too complex and apparently do not comply with this framework. Some researchers are trying to find structures in unstructured data. so that machine learning algorithms can be applied. Structures in big data should be found using techniques of Calculus even before machine learning algorithms can be applied as techniques of Statistics. A sequence over successive applications of such techniques of Calculus and Statistics may very well lead to a general theoretical model.</p> <p><b>7:20 P.M. - 7:30 P.M.  Q/A</b></p> <p><b>7:30 P.M. - 8:05 P.M.  Session 2</b></p> <p><b>Title:</b> Bayesian Network with R and Hadoop</p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> Ofer Mendelevitch, Director of Data Sciences, Hortonworks</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b>A bayesian network is an intuitive graphical model that effectively models various real world problems in fields such as genetic research, medicine, robotics, document classification, image processing and gaming.

Universe is sparse and networks follow the power law. In this talk we look at example empirical structure of human-to-human and machine interactions and seek patterns and topological structure.

Meetup Cocktail Reception\n\n– Almaden Ballroom – Hilton San Jose\n\n6:30 P.M. - 6:45 P.M. Introduction\n\n6:45 P.M. - 7:20 P.M. Session 1\n\nTitle: Mathematical Shape of Big Data and Future Challenges of Data Sciences\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Shyam Sarkar and Dr. Sanhita Sarkar, Organizers of Big Data Science\n\nAbstract: New multimodal big data sets collected from biological systems, human social systems, financial systems and many other systems are gathered even before data scientists have any hypothesis. Some scientists assert the need for an underlying global theory on a par with the invention of calculus. A broader theoretical model should integrate various techniques and tools being developed. Machine Learning currently serves as a standard technique for big data analysis. Many of the methods in machine learning are most effective when working with data matrices or sets of vectors. In many cases, data sets are too complex and apparently do not comply with this framework. Some researchers are trying to find structures in unstructured data. so that machine learning algorithms can be applied. Structures in big data should be found using techniques of Calculus even before machine learning algorithms can be applied as techniques of Statistics. A sequence over successive applications of such techniques of Calculus and Statistics may very well lead to a general theoretical model.\n\n7:20 P.M. - 7:30 P.M. Q/A\n\n7:30 P.M. - 8:05 P.M. Session 2\n\nTitle: Bayesian Network with R and Hadoop\n\nSpeaker: Ofer Mendelevitch, Director of Data Sciences, Hortonworks\n\nAbstract: A bayesian network is an intuitive graphical model that effectively models various real world problems in fields such as genetic research, medicine, robotics, document classification, image processing and gaming. In this talk Ofer will provide an overview of bayesian networks, and describe how to use R for learning of and inference with bayesian network models, covering challenges and solutions for large scale inference with bayesian network with R and Hadoop.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Ofer Mendelevitch is Director of data sciences at Hortonworks, where he is responsible for professional services involving data science with Hadoop. Prior to joining Hortonworks, Ofer served as Entrepreneur in Residence at XSeed Capital where he developed an investment strategy around big data. Before XSeed, Ofer served as VP of Engineering at Nor1, and before that he was Director of engineering at Yahoo! where he led multiple engineering and data science teams responsible for R&D of large scale computational advertising projects including CTR prediction (with Hadoop), a new front-end ad-serving system and sales tools.\n\n8:05 P.M. - 8:15 P.M. Q/A\n\n8:15 P.M. - 8:30 P.M. Break\n\n8:30 P.M. - 9:05 P.M. Session 3\n\nTitle: The Triumph of Power Law and other stories from big data\n\nSpeaker: Sri Satish Ambati, CEO of OxData\n\nAbstract: Data represents the universe and phenomena. Universe is sparse and networks follow the power law. In this talk we look at example empirical structure of human-to-human and machine interactions and seek patterns and topological structure. Some new tools like h2o and techniques like ADMM allow us to get beyond the curse of dimensionality and look for interaction amongst dimensions. The pathology of big data begins by using eigen as a lens and ends with a story that transforms innovation and enterprises. Making the world a better place with data & science is a (stochastic) process to be continued...\n\nBio of Speaker: Sri is co-founder and CEO of 0xdata (@hexadata), the builders of H2O.

These capabilities are built into the platform using our CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution Banzai Cloud PKE, service mesh via Banzai Cloud Istio Operator and K8s Federation V2.\n\nAs per a standard format, the agenda will be as follows:\n6.30pm - Arrive,\n7.00pm - 8.00pm - Talks,\n8.00pm - 09.00pm - Drinks, Pizzas","created_at":1565608473,"happened_at":1567524600},{"id":"258059098","name":"BDEVOPS @adobe in
